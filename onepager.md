# **THE PHOTOSYNTHETIC HUB**
### *Community-Owned Energy, Food & Resilience*

---

## **The Vision**

A community-owned cooperative integrating cutting-edge **perovskite solar technology**, **carbon-sequestering hempcrete construction**, and **four-season greenhouse agriculture** to create a replicable model for neighborhood resilience in New England’s challenging climate.

---

## **The Problem**

- **Food Deserts:** Limited access to fresh, affordable produce year-round  
- **Energy Poverty:** Rising costs and grid vulnerability during extreme weather  
- **Economic Displacement:** Lack of local ownership and living-wage jobs  
- **Climate Vulnerability:** New England’s harsh winters and increasing weather extremes  

---

## **The Solution**

A member-owned cooperative that transforms underutilized urban spaces into:

### **ENERGY HUB**

- **Perovskite Solar Systems:** Flexible, efficient solar integrated into building surfaces  
- **Prosumer Network:** Members generate and trade clean energy peer-to-peer  
- **Microgrid Resilience:** Community battery storage + islanding capability  
- **Carbon-Negative Operation:** Hempcrete construction sequesters more CO₂ than emitted  

### **FOOD HUB**

- **Year-Round Production:** Advanced greenhouse with thermal battery systems  
- **Winter Agriculture:** Fresh greens + vegetables through New England winters  
- **Local Distribution:** CSA, farm stand, restaurant partnerships  
- **Food Sovereignty:** Community control over production + pricing  

### **COMMUNITY HUB**

- **Worker-Owned Cooperative:** Democratic control + wealth building  
- **Living-Wage Jobs:** Year-round employment in green trades and agriculture  
- **Education Center:** Renewable energy, winter farming, cooperative development  
- **Emergency Resilience:** Warming/cooling center + food reserve
